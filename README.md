# Zig virtual meetup?

Since it's not like we're going to meet face2face anytime soon, how about we organize an online event for people to showcase what they are working on?

# How to proceed
1. Read the basic proposal I wrote in this README
2. Open an issue (or comment on an existing one) if you want to propose a different approach
3. After a while (a couple of weeks?) let's set a date and try having the first virtual meetup!

# Basic proposal

- The meetup has an explicit starting time and a fixed-length main part. After that people can leave whenever they want. Being an online event, the concept of "leaving" is also a bit fuzzy anyway.
- The main part is dedicated to showcasing intresting stuff from the community with some social interaction on top.
- The main part should not last longer than 2h total, which gives enough time for roughly two 40mins long presentations.
- The social interaction should be both via text and (optionally) via voice.

## Program structure:
- Wait for everyone to join for 5-10mins after the official starting time.
- Start the first presentation, use Twitch to broadcast it
  - Sessions should be either live or recorded (recording allows people to present even if they don't have a great connection). Live is preferred.
- At the end of each session we up to 10 mins of time for voice questions that will be answered on stream, followed by a 10 min break.
- After the main content has been presented the meetup officially ends, but people are free to stick around as long as the want.

## Misc logistics
- Discord for voice chatting & coordinating with speakers.
  - One "Main" voice channel, A few secondary ones without user caps.
- Speakers share their screen with the presenter who orchestrates the twitch stream.
  - Using discord to share the session with everybody has a user limit and I think making the presented part more public is neat. Also recording for YT is probably a good move.

## Nice to have
- Custom Zig intro/outro/whatever short videos/animations? (infinite meme-able potential)


Please open an issue if you want to suggest a change or better define any detail.
