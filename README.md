# Zig virtual meetup?

Since it's not like we're going to meet face2face anytime soon, how about we organize an online event for people to showcase what they are working on?

## Call for Art
If you watched the first episode of Zig SHOWTIME you probably remember the opening sequence.
If you know how to write short animations / demos and want to contribute to the show, I'm looking for 5 second long animations to replace the blinking "start" part of my intro, which you can [watch here](https://youtu.be/Unq712gqu2U?t=126).

## What's the event format?
If you followed some of the previous discussions on the topic of organizing an online Zig meetup, you should know this is still a work in progress. After discussing some ideas on stream and thinking more about it, I'm opting for a very simple formula to start with:

0. Instead of thinking of it as a "meetup", let's think of it as a live streamed show, max 2h long.
1. I host the show on my Twitch stream, introduce speakers who do their session, followed by a quick live Q&A at the end, by reading questions from different sources (more on that later).
2. We do 2-3 sessions per event, with a short break in the middle.

To accommodate speakers that might not be able to do the session live (e.g. because of unstable connectivity), we leave the option of pre-recording the session (which will be played on stream) and just have the live Q&A afterwards, although a fully live event is the preferred option.

Where do the questions come from? Here's the idea: we make this a BYOC event!
By BYOC (bring your own community) I mean that viewers can interact not only through Twitch chat, but also through the main communities mentioned in https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community. This way everyone will be able to stay in the groups they are already part of, and I'll come gather questions right where they are comfortable staying. 

In practical terms, for this first event, I'll be present in both the Zig Discord and the #zig IRC channel on Freenode, so viewers will also be able to ask questions there, on top of Twitch. As for any other social interaction, well that's up to the viewers whether they want to be in IRC, Discord, both or neither.

I believe this is a reasonable starting point that also is aligned with Zig's idea of a decentralized community, as outlined in the wiki page linked above. In the future it might be worth exploring new ways of interacting.
