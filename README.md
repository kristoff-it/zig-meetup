# Zig virtual meetup?

Since it's not like we're going to meet face2face anytime soon, how about we organize an online event for people to showcase what they are working on?

# How to proceed
1. Read the basic proposal I wrote in this README
2. Open an issue (or comment on an existing one) if you want to propose a different approach
3. After a while (a couple of weeks?) let's set a date and try having the first virtual meetup!


# Basic proposal

We decide a time and date for the meetup to take place. We then join a Discord server (the one linked in in the wiki? assuming owners are ok with the idea) at that time and have a short initial time where people can interact however they want. After giving enough time for people to come (e.g. 5-10mins) we start with the main program, which should be 2 presentations?

- The main session (i.e. the presentations + intermediate breaks) should be no longer than a couple of hours.
- Each presentation should be no longer than 40 mins.
- Between each presentation there should be a break (15 mins?)
- Presentations should work as follows:
  - We livestream the presentation (e.g. on Twitch), people use Twitch chat for comments (or Discord?)
  - After the presentation we reserve some time (10mins?) for voice questions (still on Twitch)
  - After voice questions we have a the 15 mins break where people can chat freely (not streamed on Twitch)
  - Same again for the second presentation.

Discord would allow to have people split in small voice rooms during the main session time (if they want to voice chat in small groups during the presentation) and have everybody be in the same room during breaks, or have people avoid voice and just participate through text.

Please open an issue if you want to suggest a change or better define any detail.
